    <h2>A Graph Visualization of the Relationships between Quantum Cryptographic Primitives in MicroCrypt</h2>
    <p>The graph on this website describes known connections between quantum cryptographic primitives. 
    We only show MicroCrypt: primitves that are based on assumptions which are potentially wearker than one-way functions.
    Hovering with your mouse cursor over a connection will show a tooltip with reference to a work that investigates the relation between the two connected nodes.
    Clicking on the connection will take you to a website with more details on the respective work.
    Hovering over a node will show a tooltip with the name of the primitive and other.
    Nodes which share a color are equivalent.</p>
