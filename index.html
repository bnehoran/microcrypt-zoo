    <h2>A Graph Visualization of the Relationships between Quantum Cryptographic Primitives in MicroCrypt</h2>
    <p>The graph on this website describes known connections between quantum cryptographic primitives. 
    We only show MicroCrypt: primitves that are based on assumptions which are potentially wearker than one-way functions.
    Black edge between A and B means that there is a (not necessasrily black-box) construction of B from A. A red edge from B to A means that B is black-box separated from A. 
    Hovering with your mouse cursor over an edge will show a tooltip with reference to a work that investigates the relation between the two connected nodes.
    Clicking an edge will take you to a website with more details on the respective work.
    Hovering over a node will show a tooltip with the name of the primitive and other details.
    Nodes which share a color are equivalent.</p>

    <p>The zookeeper is Or Sattath. Contributions are welcome! See <a href="https://github.com/sattath/microcrypt-zoo">https://github.com/sattath/microcrypt-zoo</a> for details.</p>
